# Underactuated Robotics

Python implementations of Optimal Control, Optimization and Reinforcement Learning algorithms
applied in underactuated robots and dynamical systems.

Inspired by the MIT's course [6.832 - Underactuated Robotics](http://underactuated.mit.edu/underactuated.html) 
of [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html).
The corresponding [edX course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.832x_2+3T2015/course/) as well as the course notes largely assisted in studying the mathematical background of the showcased
algorithms.

## Implementations
